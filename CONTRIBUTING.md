## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to envio!

Any form of contribution is accepted, be it bug fixes, implementing a new feature or even just fixing a small typo. 

pull requests for bug fixes and features will only be accepted if the approach has been discussed in an issue and a community memeber has been given the go-ahead to work on it

Please keep the following in mind at all times:

* Check existing issues to verify that the [`bug`](https://github.com/envio-cli/envio/labels/bug) or [`feature request`](https://github.com/envio-cli/envio/labels/feature%20request) has not already been submitted.
* Open an issue if things aren't working as expected.
* Open an issue to propose a significant change.
* Open a pull request to fix a bug.

* Open a pull request for any issue labelled [`help wanted`](https://github.com/envio-cli/envio/labels/help%20wanted), [`good first issue`](https://github.com/envio-cli/envio/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [`community`](https://github.com/envio-cli/envio/labels/community).

Please avoid:

* Opening pull requests for issues marked `needs-triage`, `needs-investigation`, or `blocked`.
* Opening pull requests for any issue marked `maintainers`. These issues require additional context from
  the maintainers/code owners and any external pull requests will not be accepted.
