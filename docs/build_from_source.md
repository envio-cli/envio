# Build from source (Still a work in progress)

Verify that you have Rust installed:

```sh
$ rustc --version
```

If `rust` is not installed, follow the instructions on [the Offical Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Clone this repository:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/humblepenguinn/envio.git
$ cd envio
```

Build the project:

```sh
$ cargo build
```


Now, Check to see if it worked:
```sh
$ cargo run -- version
```
